In this paper we utilize county-level temperature, mosquito surveillance, and human WNV case data form NYS ranging from 1999 to 2024 to understand the impact of temperature on WNV transmissions season length over the last 25 years. We hypothesized that longer transmission season would be associated with increased WNV risk and found that:

1.	Transmission season length, determined to be days with mean temperature above 16.7°C, has significantly increased in New York State over the last 25 years.
2.	Further analyses revealed transmission season is beginning significantly earlier and ending significantly later based on transmission data, ending on average 16 days later.
3.	Longer transmissions seasons were associated with increased WNV prevalence in mosquitoes and humans. 

Here you will find code used to analyze and visualize temperature, mosquito surveillance, and human WNV case data.
